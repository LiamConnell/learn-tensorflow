#TensorFlow Learner's ScratchPad

As I learn tensorflow I apply it to financial time series data. So far I have created a simple regression, multi-layer perceptron neural network, an LSTM recurrent neural network, and a Policy Gradient Reinforcement Learning network. This repository will be revamped soon to me a better educational resource and have a cleaner presentation of my projects and results. I'll like to the new version here when I have it. 

###Teach Yourself

I've been asked a few times to share the resources that I use for learning about Deep Learning. Here are a few.

[Adrej Karpathy's blog](http://karpathy.github.io/) especially his articles on [recurrent neural networks](http://karpathy.github.io/2015/05/21/rnn-effectiveness/) and [reinforcement learning](http://karpathy.github.io/2016/05/31/rl/). He's a fantastic communicator and educator and he also wrote the [classic example of a RNN](https://github.com/karpathy/char-rnn). 

[Chris Olah's blog](http://colah.github.io/), his article on [LSTM](http://colah.github.io/posts/2015-08-Understanding-LSTMs/) explains the difficult to explain.

I use [tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/), google's deep learning python package. It is well documented and if I can teach it to myself in my spare time so can you.
